      <h2 id="header2"> Introduction </h2>
      <p> Hello, my name is Jolien Mesure. I'm from Houthulst, West Flanders, Belgium. I've lived there for about nine years now. I'm a mom 
          of three children; two boys and one girl and I'm a wife. 
          </p>
          <h2> Background </h2>
            <p> I studied human science in middle school whereafter I graduated with an academic bachelor in experimental psychology. In those classes we were introduced to health science. Because I found this very intresting I changed my master degree to health promotion and education. I finished this in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>After my studies I worked as an caregiver in 'De Vleugels' in Klerken. There I took care of ten young adults with a mental disability and behavioural and emotional difficulties. I found this very intresting and I learned much, like teamwork, flexibility... I work there since december 2015.
            </p>
            <p>Now I feel I need a change. the caregiving job doesn't give me the energy it used to be. When I look at my talents, they lay elsewhere. I'm very analytic, result-minded, conventional and human-centered, in a way that I like helping people. Most of those tallents don't flourish in the job as a caregiver. This is the reason why I opted to IT, and, to be more specific, programming. In my studies in experimental psychology I was introduced to the programming language C++. This I found very fun. And so I come to a cariere switch to programming.
            </p>
            <p>To do this I introduced myself to different courses online. Namely courses from the VDAB, online courses with videos, like the cs50 course of Harvard, sololearm... This all convienced me to go further in the programming world. Therefore I enlisted in a graduate study in programming at the Howest in Brugges. 
            </p>
            <p>At last I have done multiple volunteer work. This as a coach to children and work to take care of horses, a project to enhance alcohol awarness in students... I found this very useful to learn more and to further grow as a person.
            </p>
